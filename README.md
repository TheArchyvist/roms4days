![The Rom Vault](https://github.com/TheArchyvist/the-rom-vault/blob/master/Assests%20and%20Notes/Pictures/roms%20vault%20resized.png)

Because I am sick and tired of Nintendo constantly DCMA striking everything that has their name attached to it, everything including legally obtained rom-dumps, and fan made games, some of which we're absolutely astounding, if I were to add, I've decided to leak every rom that I could possibly find onto this archive. Please be patient though, if you were to stumble across this repostiory, and keep it quiet. Mind you, with the thousands of files, it will take some time to upload. I will do my best to update this archive, but I am only one person, so if anyone is willing to contribute some roms before Big Boss comes and sweeps us out of existence, it would be greatly appreciated!

# How to Use
You can use this archive several ways. You can use the following links to download and view the archives, or you can use the "Go to File" button located on top of this repostiory and search for a file that might be located into the archive. Make sure to check out the Releases Tab, becuase I will be uploading zipped files there.
